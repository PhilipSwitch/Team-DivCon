# AI Conversation Engine - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 What's Been Added

Your Plansmart app now has **intelligent AI conversation capabilities** that can:

1. **Detect User Intent** - Understands what the user wants (create schedule, add task, view tasks, etc.)
2. **Generate Smart Suggestions** - Provides contextual suggestions based on:
   - Whether user has existing schedules or tasks
   - Number of incomplete tasks
   - Today's schedule status
   - Conversation history
3. **Engage in Natural Conversation** - Responds with friendly, emoji-enhanced messages
4. **Speak Responses** - Uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to read AI responses aloud

## 📁 New Files Created

### `conversation_engine.py`
The core AI conversation engine that:
- Analyzes user input to detect intent
- Queries database for user state (tasks, schedules)
- Generates context-aware responses
- Maintains conversation history

**Key Classes:**
- `ConversationEngine` - Main conversation handler
- `get_ai_response()` - Public function to get AI response

## 🔄 Modified Files

### `app.py`
**Changes:**
- Imported `conversation_engine` module
- Updated `/process_input` endpoint to use `get_ai_response()`
- Now returns `ai_response` field with intelligent suggestions
- Added `user_id` tracking for personalized responses

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /get_suggestion` - Get AI suggestion based on user state
- `POST /chat` - Pure chat endpoint for conversation
- `GET /get_conversation_history` - Get full conversation history

### `script.js`
**Changes:**
- Updated `processVoiceInput()` to use `ai_response` from server
- Enhanced `displayMessage()` with AI message styling
- Added emoji filtering for Text-to-Speech
- Better error handling

### `styles.css`
**New Styles:**
- `.ai-message` - Styled AI response container with gradient background
- `slideIn` animation - Smooth message appearance
- Updated `#transcript` - Better message display with flexbox

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Start the Backend**
```bash
cd c:\Users\bensa\Documents\Team-DivCon\Plansmart_backend\ai-assistant\backend
python app.py
```

### 2. **Open Frontend**
Open `index.html` in your browser at `http://localhost:5000` (or wherever you host it)

### 3. **Test AI Interactions**

#### Test Case 1: Greeting
- **Say/Type:** "Hi there"
- **Expected:** AI greets you and asks about your current state

#### Test Case 2: No Schedules Yet
- **Say/Type:** "What should I do?"
- **Expected:** AI suggests creating a schedule or adding tasks

#### Test Case 3: Create Task
- **Say/Type:** "Create task to finish project report"
- **Expected:** AI acknowledges and suggests organizing into a schedule

#### Test Case 4: View Tasks
- **Say/Type:** "Show my tasks"
- **Expected:** AI lists your incomplete tasks and offers suggestions

## 🧠 How AI Intent Detection Works

The engine recognizes these intents:
- `greeting` - "hi", "hello", "hey", "good morning"
- `help` - "help", "what can you do", "suggest"
- `create_schedule` - "create schedule", "new schedule", "add schedule"
- `add_task` - "create task", "add task", "new task"
- `view_tasks` - "show tasks", "my tasks", "view tasks"
- `view_schedules` - "show schedules", "my schedules", "list schedules"
- `mark_done` - "mark done", "complete task", "finished"

## 💬 Example AI Responses

### Scenario 1: User with no data
```
Good morning! 🌅
Would you like to create a new schedule or add your first task?

What would you like to do?
• Create a new schedule
• Add tasks to existing schedules
• View your tasks
• View your schedules
```

### Scenario 2: User with tasks but no schedule
```
✅ You have 3 incomplete task(s).

What would you like to do?
• Create a new schedule
• Add tasks to existing schedules
• View your tasks
• View your schedules
```

### Scenario 3: User with both tasks and schedules
```
✨ Everything looks organized! What would you like to do next?

What would you like to do?
• Create a new schedule
• Add tasks to existing schedules
• View your tasks
• View your schedules
```

## 🔄 Conversation Flow

```
User speaks/types input
    ↓
Frontend sends to /process_input or /chat
    ↓
Backend gets user_id from session
    ↓
conversation_engine.detect_intent()
    ↓
conversation_engine.get_user_state()
    ↓
Generate context-aware response
    ↓
Return response + TTS
    ↓
Frontend displays message with animation
    ↓
Text-to-Speech reads message aloud
```

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

- **AI Messages** have a distinct purple gradient background with left border
- **Slide-in animation** when messages appear
- **Emojis** for visual context (📅, ✅, ⏰, etc.)
- **Responsive formatting** with proper line breaks
- **Auto-scroll** to latest message

## 📊 Data Structure

### Conversation History Entry
```json
{
  "user": "create schedule for tomorrow",
  "ai": "Let's create a new schedule...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "intents": ["create_schedule"]
}
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: LLM Integration
When you have an OpenAI API key:

1. Replace `generate_response()` with LLM call
2. Use user state as context for better suggestions
3. Enable more natural conversations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Pattern recognition for task suggestions
- Schedule optimization recommendations
- Natural language time parsing ("tomorrow at 2pm")
- Multi-turn conversations with context

## ⚙️ Configuration

If you need to modify behavior:

**In `conversation_engine.py`:**
- `detect_intent()` - Add more keywords or intents
- `get_user_state()` - Modify what data is considered
- `_*_response()` methods - Customize response templates

**In `script.js`:**
- `displayMessage()` - Change emoji filtering
- `processVoiceInput()` - Modify response handling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### AI says "processed" instead of smart response
- Ensure `conversation_engine.py` is in the same directory as `app.py`
- Check that imports are working: `from conversation_engine import get_ai_response`

### Text-to-Speech not working
- Check browser permissions for audio output
- Verify emojis are being filtered properly
- Check browser console for errors

### User state not updating
- Ensure user is logged in (session['user_id'] is set)
- Check database queries are working
- Verify tasks/schedules are being saved

## 📝 Notes

- All responses are stored in `conversation_history`
- User context updates in real-time based on current database state
- Each user gets personalized responses (if logged in)
- Works without external APIs (can be enhanced later with LLM)
