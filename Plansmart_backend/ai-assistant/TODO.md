# TODO for Improving AI Assistant

- [x] Enhance input parsing: Improve OpenAI prompt in app.py to handle complex natural language, multi-step requests, and clarifications
- [x] Utilize conversation history: Pass full history to OpenAI for contextual responses
- [x] Add personalization: Include user tasks and schedules in prompts for tailored suggestions
- [x] Improve error handling: Better fallbacks and user feedback for parsing failures in app.py
- [x] Add TTS: Implement text-to-speech for AI responses in script.js
- [x] Integrate buttons with AI: Update sidebar button event listeners in script.js to trigger AI-guided prompts
- [x] Improve conversation persistence: Modify script.js to append messages to transcript instead of overwriting for better user experience
- [x] Connect to open source AI: Integrate Ollama for interactive responses using llama2 model
- [x] Update index.html: Add TTS controls if needed
- [x] Test improvements: Run Flask app, interact via voice/text, verify context, TTS, and button integrations
